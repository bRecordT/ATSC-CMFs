# ATSC CMFs
A Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) sponsored research project 

## Overview
The project objective is evaluating safety effectiveness of Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC). This is achieved by estimating various crash modification factors (CMFs) using Empirical Bayes before-after study methodology (*[Hauer, E., 1997](https://books.emeraldinsight.com/page/detail/?k=9780080430539)*).   
The safety performance functions (SPFs) applied in this study are built upon previous research projects
* Safety Performance Functions, Donnell et al., 2014
* Regionalized Safety Performance Functions, Donnell et al., 2016
* Regionalized Urban-Suburban Collector Road Safety Performance Functions, Donnell et al., 2019
